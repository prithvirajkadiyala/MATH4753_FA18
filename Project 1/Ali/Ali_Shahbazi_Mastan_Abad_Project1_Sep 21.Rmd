abstract: This project is all about analysing the SWDEFECTS file using R and probability theory. You will need to change the headings to reflect the nature of the project intentions. Re write this abstract as the last thing you do.

# Introduction to the data

## Data and variables(see MS pg. 77,125)
**Describe the data and the problem we wish to investigate.**
In this case it is NASA or we can say any company that they are collecting data we would like to know if the data that they are collecting is right and following by that we would like to know if the software or code that we are using to collect data is working precise without any fault.

So, the question is how can we do that? There are many ways to see if the collected data is right or wrong which in this case we are considering 4 different methods to see if their prediction of faulty data is right or wrong. These methods should be applied to collected data.

The data is constructed from the data fromt the satelite and if there is any defect and the prediction of each alorithm and what they say. If there is any defect in the data then it is *TRUE* and if there is not it is *FALSE*

In this project we should be able to load data and by writing our own functions calculate the *probabilities* of Algorithm is correct, predict defect given module has defect, predict defect given modules has no defect, and module has defect given predict defect.

## Summary Table 
**Create the summary table (TABLE SIA3.2) found on page 125.**
Using $\LaTeX$ construct the formulae for 

1. Accuracy
2. Detection rate
3. False alarm rate
4. Precision

$1. Accuracy: P(Algorithm is correct) = \frac{(a+d)}{(a+b+c+d)}$

$2. Detection Rate: P(predict defect|module has defect)=\frac{d}{(b+d)}$

$3. Fals alarm Rate: P(predict defect|module has no defect)=\frac{c}{(a+c)}$

$4. Precision: P(module has defect|predict defect)=\frac{d}{(d+c)}$

# R functions
**Using the above definitions make R functions that will create the required probabilities, please remove `eval=FALSE` when creating the functions:**

1. I am going to do is first I am going to load the data file into an object name collected.data.

2. Definition of a,b,c, and d is as below:

<center>
![Definition of a,b,c, and d](TableSIA32 - Definition abcd.png){width=50%}
</center>

which is showing which method is predicting if there is any defect or not and if there is actually a defect.

3. Continue with that I am going to count the situation a,b,c, and d for each method

#Create the table on page 127, TABLE SIA3.3
##Table and Barplot with Values
If we consider the initial value that we calculated a,b,c, and d for each method then we would have a bar plot and the SIA3.3 table as below:

```{r}
vg10.a
vg10.b
vg10.c
vg10.d
evg14.5a
evg14.5b
evg14.5c
evg14.5d
ivg9.2a
ivg9.2b
ivg9.2c
ivg9.2d
loc50.a
loc50.b
loc50.c
loc50.d

a1=acc(loc50.a,loc50.b,loc50.c,loc50.d)

b2=detect(vg10.b,vg10.d)
b3=detect(evg14.5b,evg14.5d)
b4=detect(ivg9.2b,ivg9.2d)
b1=detect(loc50.b,loc50.d)

probs=c("Accuracy","Detection Rate","False Alarm Rate", "Precision")
  mths = c("Lines of Code", "Cyclomatic complexity", "Essential complexity", "Design complexity")
  
  alltab = matrix(c(a1,a2,a3,a4,b1,b2,b3,b4,c1,c2,c3,c4,d1,d2,d3,d4),nr=4,nc=4,dimnames=list(mths,probs))
  
  alltab
  
barplot(alltab, ylab="Probabilities", beside=TRUE, col=rainbow(20))
```


## Defining the function
Defining the function that gives the table as SIA3.3 needs 16 input; the reason for that is we have 4 methods which for each method we should consider 4 output that two of them the method predicts defect which for one of them it is correct and for two of them predicts no defect that also in this case only of them is correct. so $4\times4=16$ input is needed to form the table. The function is as below:
```{r}
mytable=function(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p)
