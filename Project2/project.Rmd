# Introduction

Here you should introduce the data and the problem you wish to solve.
Use your  own subheadings. Fill with informative sentences and pictures and links.
You may inclucde sub-sub headings.
You can cite from your bibliography [see @millar and @crawley]

The data was collected here:

```{r map, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
leaflet() %>%
  setView(lng=-97.445717, lat=35.205894, zoom= 16) %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng=-97.445717, lat=35.205894, popup="We collected grasshoppers here!! Dr Stewart helped.") 
```



## What are the variables? 
```{r datacars}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```

```{r carnames}
names(mtcars)
```


### Sub sub headings can be useful

[^1]: A little footnote

### Plot data

```{r carcharacteristics, fig.height = 5, fig.cap = "MTCARS",fig.align='center',fig.cap="Graph of data with loess smoother"}
library(ggplot2)
g = ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg, color = cyl)) + geom_point()
g = g + geom_smooth(method = "loess")
g
```


## How were the data collected? 

## What is the story behind the data?

## Why was it gathered? 

## What is your interest in the data?

### Include pictures `![](jpeg)`

## What problem do you wish to solve?

# Theory needed to carry out SLR
## Main result 1
## Main result 2
## Main result 3 etc

# Validity with mathematical expressions


The following function was taken from [https://rpubs.com/therimalaya/43190](https://rpubs.com/therimalaya/43190)

## Checks on validity

### Straight trend line  

#### Use trendscatter

### Errors distributed Normally

$$\epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$$



#### Shapiro-wilk

### Constant variance

#### Residual vs fitted values

#### trendscatter on Residual Vs Fitted

### Zero mean value of $\epsilon$

### Independence of data 

# Model selection if you compared models 

## Use adjusted $R^2$ 
$$R_{adj}^2 =$$



# Analysis of the data

## Make sure you include many great plots

## Add the trend to the data


## Summary lm object

### Interpretation of all tests
### Interpretation of multiple R squared
### Interpretation of all point estimates
## Calculate cis for $\beta$ parameter estimates
### Use of `predict()`
### Use of `ciReg()`

### Check on outliers using cooks plots

Remember to interpret this plot and all other plots



# Conclusion
## Answer your research question
## Suggest ways to improve model or experiment
